Feature: sm-ncc-sync channel listing and enablement
  In Order to validate correct working of sm-ncc-sync
  As user root
  I want to be able to list available channels and enable them

  Scenario: list available channels
     When I execute ncc-sync "--list-channels"
     Then I want to get "[.] sles11-sp1-pool-x86_64"
      And I want to get "    [.] sle11-sdk-sp1-updates-x86_64"

  Scenario: enable sles11-sp1-pool-x86_64
     When I execute ncc-sync "--channel sles11-sp1-pool-x86_64"
      And I execute ncc-sync "--list-channels"
     Then I want to get "[P] sles11-sp1-pool-x86_64"
      And I want to get "    [.] sle11-sdk-sp1-updates-x86_64"

  Scenario: enable sles11-sp1-updates-x86_64
